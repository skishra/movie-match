# Movie Match

The Movie Match app is a fun way to decide what to watch, taking inspiration from popular dating apps such as Tinder. Users swipe through movie recommendations, and with each round, the list of options narrows down until the final movie selection is made.

For registered users, Movie Match allows them to save preferred genres and keep track of films watched previously, making the recommendations better over time.

Imagine you and your friends are hanging out but can't agree on a movie. This app not only helps you decide but also turns the process into a party game.
