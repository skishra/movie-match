# Movie Match

The Movie Match app is a fun way to decide what to watch, taking some inspiration from popular dating such as Tinder. Users swipe through movie recommendations, and with each round, the list of options narrows down until the final movie selection is made.

For registered users, Movie Match allows the saving of preferred genres and keeping track of films watched previously, making the recommendations offered better over time.

Imagine you and your friends are hanging out but can't agree on a movie. This app not only helps you decide but also turns the process into a party game of its own. Whether it's a solo night, or with a group of people, Movie Match makes picking a movie into a fun game.
